Note: This modern way of writing classes is supported in all modern browsers, but it is still worth knowing about the underlying prototypal inheritance in case you work on a project that requires supporting a browser that doesn't support this syntax (most notably Internet Explorer).

Note: Under the hood, your classes are being converted into Prototypal Inheritance models â€” this is just syntactic sugar. But I'm sure you'll agree that it's easier to write.
